Compatible with 64-bit Windows and M-chip Mac, the author mainly uses it to view PDFs and check answers; it doesn't have many functions but is quite convenient

适配 64 位 windows 与 m 芯片 mac，作者主要用来看 PDF 对答案，没多大功能但也算挺方便；

The developer is a computer science student who will definitely not engage in computer technology work. He suffered a lot in his freshman year and deeply regretted choosing the computer major

开发者是一个绝对不会从事计算机技术工作的计算机学生，大一学的特别痛苦，非常后悔选了计算机专业；

Later, through repeated practice, he realized that even with low proficiency, learning computer science can indeed enable one to do some different things, and gradually felt less regretful. Therefore, he wants to record this

后来在一次次实践中体会到到即使水平低，但是学习计算机确实可以做一些不一样的事情，慢慢没那么后悔了，因此记录一下；

Maybe no matter what major I study or what I do, my views will change. But there's no need to think about the paths not taken. The wind doesn't know where it will go or when it will stop; it only sees the clouds on the horizon and the wildflowers on the grassland

也许不管我学什么专业乃至做什么事情，都会有看法的改观，但没必要想没走过的路，风不知道自己会去哪，什么时候停下，它只看见天边的云彩与草原的野花。
